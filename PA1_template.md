## Loading and preprocessing the data...

```r
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day...

```r
# Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
library(ggplot2)
total.steps <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
qplot(total.steps, binwidth=1000, xlab="total number of steps taken each day")
```

![plot of chunk Question 1-1](figure/Question 1-1-1.png) 

Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day...

```r
mean(total.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```

```
## [1] 9354.23
```

```r
median(total.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```

```
## [1] 10395
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)...

```r
library(ggplot2)
averages <- aggregate(x=list(steps=data$steps), by=list(interval=data$interval),
                      FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
ggplot(data=averages, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) +
    geom_line() +
    xlab("5-minute interval") +
    ylab("average number of steps taken")
```

![plot of chunk Question 2-1](figure/Question 2-1-1.png) 

Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```r
averages[which.max(averages$steps),]
```

```
##     interval    steps
## 104      835 206.1698
```

## Imputing missing values

Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)...

```r
missing <- is.na(data$steps)
table(missing)
```

```
## missing
## FALSE  TRUE 
## 15264  2304
```

Strategy for missing value: Replace missing values with the mean value of its 5-minute interval

```r
fill.value <- function(steps, interval) {
    filled <- NA
    if (!is.na(steps))
        filled <- c(steps)
    else
        filled <- (averages[averages$interval==interval, "steps"])
    return(filled)
}
```

Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```r
filled.data <- data
filled.data$steps <- mapply(fill.value, filled.data$steps, filled.data$interval)
```

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

```r
total.steps <- tapply(filled.data$steps, filled.data$date, FUN=sum)
qplot(total.steps, binwidth=1000, xlab="total number of steps taken each day")
```

![plot of chunk Question 3-4](figure/Question 3-4-1.png) 

```r
mean(total.steps)
```

```
## [1] 10766.19
```

```r
median(total.steps)
```

```
## [1] 10766.19
```

Mean and median values are higher after missing data are also considered. 
There are some days with `steps` values `NA` for any `interval`. The total number of steps in these days will be defaulted to 0. With NA's replaced with mean value, these data is also consider and hence the mean and median value is now higher.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels -- "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.


```r
weekday.or.weekend <- function(date) {
    day <- weekdays(date)
    if (day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"))
        return("weekday")
    else if (day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"))
        return("weekend")
    else
        stop("invalid date")
}
filled.data$date <- as.Date(filled.data$date)
filled.data$day <- sapply(filled.data$date, FUN=weekday.or.weekend)
```

Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). 

```r
averages <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + day, data=filled.data, mean)
ggplot(averages, aes(interval, steps)) + geom_line() + facet_grid(day ~ .) +
    xlab("5-minute interval") + ylab("Number of steps")
```
